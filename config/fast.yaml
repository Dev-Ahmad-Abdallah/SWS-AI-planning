# Fast configuration - smaller inflation, faster speeds, lower obstacle weights

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.5
  length: 0.7
  v_max: 2.5       # m/s max forward velocity (faster but still realistic)
  omega_max: 2.0   # rad/s max angular velocity (smooth turning)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.7       # LARGER inflation radius to keep paths AWAY from shelves (was 0.2)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 1.0       # balanced goal weight
  w_obs: 5.0        # HIGHER obstacle weight - prefer clearance over speed
  w_smooth: 0.5     # balanced smoothness weight
  lookahead: 2.0    # longer lookahead for better clearance
  min_clearance: 0.8  # LARGER minimum clearance - keep robot AWAY from shelves
  
# Re-planning
replan:
  threshold_clearance: 0.6   # increased threshold to trigger earlier
  threshold_progress: 0.01
  timeout: 30.0
  
# Sensors
lidar:
  fov: 360
  resolution: 1.5   # degrees per beam (240 beams - good balance)
  max_range: 6.0    # good range for warehouse
  update_rate: 25   # higher update rate for faster config
  
# Simulation
sim:
  fps: 60

  window_width: 1280
  window_height: 720
  grid_resolution: 0.5  # Larger cells for clearer 2D grid (0.5m per cell)
