# Baseline configuration - balanced parameters

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.4        # REDUCED: Smaller robot for better maneuverability (reduced from 0.5)
  length: 0.5        # REDUCED: Smaller robot for better maneuverability (reduced from 0.7)
  v_max: 3.0       # INCREASED: Faster forward velocity (increased from 2.0)
  omega_max: 3.5   # INCREASED: Much higher rotational speed (increased from 1.5)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.6        # REDUCED: Smaller inflation radius with smaller robot (reduced from 1.0)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 5.0       # FIXED: Much higher weight for goal progress - prioritize path following (was 2.0)
  w_obs: 8.0        # Higher weight for obstacle avoidance
  w_smooth: 1.0     # FIXED: Reduced smoothness weight - allow necessary turns (was 3.0)
  lookahead: 2.0    # FIXED: Shorter lookahead for better path following (was 2.5)
  min_clearance: 0.6  # REDUCED: Smaller clearance with smaller robot and inflation (reduced from 1.0)
  
# Re-planning
replan:
  threshold_clearance: 0.45  # REDUCED: Adjusted for smaller clearance (reduced from 0.7)
  threshold_progress: 0.005    # OPTIMIZED: Lower threshold for progress - trigger earlier
  timeout: 20.0              # OPTIMIZED: Shorter timeout - replan sooner when stuck
  
# Sensors
lidar:
  fov: 360          # field of view in degrees (360 = full circle)
  resolution: 1.5   # degrees per beam (240 beams - good balance of detail and performance)
  max_range: 8.0    # maximum range in meters/pixels (longer range for warehouse)
  update_rate: 20   # Hz (good update rate)
  
# Simulation
sim:
  fps: 60           # target frames per second
  dt: 0.01667       # timestep (1/60)
  window_width: 1280
  window_height: 720
  grid_resolution: 0.5  # meters/pixels per grid cell - reasonable size for 2D grid
  
# RNG seed for deterministic runs
seed: 42
