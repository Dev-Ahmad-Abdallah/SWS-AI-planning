# Safe configuration - larger inflation, slower speeds, higher obstacle weights

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.4        # REDUCED: Smaller robot for better maneuverability (reduced from 0.5)
  length: 0.5        # REDUCED: Smaller robot for better maneuverability (reduced from 0.7)
  v_max: 2.5       # INCREASED: Faster forward velocity (increased from 1.5)
  omega_max: 3.0   # INCREASED: Much higher rotational speed (increased from 1.0)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.65        # REDUCED: Smaller inflation radius with smaller robot (reduced from 1.1)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 6.0       # FIXED: Much higher weight for goal progress - prioritize path following (was 2.0)
  w_obs: 9.0        # Higher weight for obstacle avoidance - maximum safety
  w_smooth: 1.2     # FIXED: Reduced smoothness weight - allow necessary turns (was 3.5)
  lookahead: 2.5    # FIXED: Shorter lookahead for better path following (was 3.0)
  min_clearance: 0.65  # REDUCED: Smaller clearance with smaller robot and inflation (reduced from 1.2)
  
# Re-planning
replan:
  threshold_clearance: 0.5  # REDUCED: Adjusted for smaller clearance (reduced from 0.8)
  threshold_progress: 0.005  # OPTIMIZED: Lower threshold for earlier replan
  timeout: 15.0    # OPTIMIZED: Shorter timeout - replan sooner
