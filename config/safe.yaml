# Safe configuration - larger inflation, slower speeds, higher obstacle weights

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.5
  length: 0.7
  v_max: 10.0       # m/s (10x faster while maintaining safety margins)
  omega_max: 8.0    # rad/s (10x faster turning)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.8        # LARGER inflation radius to keep paths AWAY from shelves (was 0.5)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 1.0       # balanced goal weight
  w_obs: 5.0        # HIGHER weight for obstacle avoidance - prefer clearance over speed
  w_smooth: 0.5     # balanced smoothness weight
  lookahead: 2.5    # longer lookahead
  min_clearance: 0.5  # LARGER minimum clearance - keep distance from obstacles (was 0.3)
