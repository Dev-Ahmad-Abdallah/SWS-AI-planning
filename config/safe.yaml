# Safe configuration - larger inflation, slower speeds, higher obstacle weights

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.5
  length: 0.7
  v_max: 1.5       # m/s max forward velocity (slow and safe)
  omega_max: 1.0   # rad/s max angular velocity (cautious turning)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.8        # LARGER inflation radius to keep paths AWAY from shelves (was 0.5)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 1.0       # balanced goal weight
  w_obs: 5.0        # HIGHER weight for obstacle avoidance - prefer clearance over speed
  w_smooth: 0.5     # balanced smoothness weight
  lookahead: 2.5    # longer lookahead
  min_clearance: 1.0  # LARGER minimum clearance - keep robot AWAY from shelves (safe mode)
  
# Re-planning
replan:
  threshold_clearance: 0.7  # higher threshold to trigger earlier
  threshold_progress: 0.01
  timeout: 30.0
  
# Sensors
lidar:
  fov: 360
  resolution: 1.5   # degrees per beam (240 beams - good balance)
  max_range: 6.0    # longer range
  update_rate: 20
