# Fast configuration - smaller inflation, faster speeds, lower obstacle weights

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.4        # REDUCED: Smaller robot for better maneuverability (reduced from 0.5)
  length: 0.5        # REDUCED: Smaller robot for better maneuverability (reduced from 0.7)
  v_max: 3.5       # INCREASED: Faster forward velocity (increased from 2.5)
  omega_max: 4.0   # INCREASED: Much higher rotational speed (increased from 2.0)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.55       # REDUCED: Smaller inflation radius with smaller robot (reduced from 0.9)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 5.0       # FIXED: Much higher weight for goal progress - prioritize path following (was 2.0)
  w_obs: 8.0        # Higher weight for obstacle avoidance
  w_smooth: 1.0     # FIXED: Reduced smoothness weight - allow necessary turns (was 3.0)
  lookahead: 2.0    # FIXED: Shorter lookahead for better path following (was 2.5)
  min_clearance: 0.55  # REDUCED: Smaller clearance with smaller robot and inflation (reduced from 0.9)
  
# Re-planning
replan:
  threshold_clearance: 0.4   # REDUCED: Adjusted for smaller clearance (reduced from 0.65)
  threshold_progress: 0.005   # OPTIMIZED: Lower threshold for earlier replan
  timeout: 18.0    # OPTIMIZED: Shorter timeout - replan sooner
  
# Sensors
lidar:
  fov: 360
  resolution: 1.5   # degrees per beam (240 beams - good balance)
  max_range: 6.0    # good range for warehouse
  update_rate: 25   # higher update rate for faster config
