# Baseline configuration - balanced parameters

# Robot parameters
robot:
  width: 0.5        # meters (or pixels)
  length: 0.7        # meters (or pixels)
  v_max: 2.0       # m/s max forward velocity (realistic warehouse speed)
  omega_max: 1.5   # rad/s max angular velocity (smooth turning)
  
# Inflation and C-space
inflation:
  radius: 0.8        # LARGER inflation radius to keep paths AWAY from shelves (was 0.3)
  
# Local avoidance (DWA-like)
local_avoid:
  w_goal: 1.0       # weight for goal progress
  w_obs: 5.0        # HIGHER weight for obstacle avoidance - prefer clearance over speed
  w_smooth: 0.5     # weight for smoothness
  lookahead: 2.0    # prediction horizon
  min_clearance: 0.8  # LARGER minimum clearance - keep robot AWAY from shelves (was 0.5)
  
# Re-planning
replan:
  threshold_clearance: 0.6  # clearance < this triggers re-plan (increased to trigger earlier)
  threshold_progress: 0.01    # progress < this triggers re-plan
  timeout: 30.0              # max time without progress before re-plan
  
# Sensors
lidar:
  fov: 360          # field of view in degrees (360 = full circle)
  resolution: 1.5   # degrees per beam (240 beams - good balance of detail and performance)
  max_range: 8.0    # maximum range in meters/pixels (longer range for warehouse)
  update_rate: 20   # Hz (good update rate)
  
# Simulation
sim:
  fps: 60           # target frames per second
  dt: 0.01667       # timestep (1/60)
  window_width: 1280
  window_height: 720
  grid_resolution: 0.5  # meters/pixels per grid cell - reasonable size for 2D grid
  
# RNG seed for deterministic runs
seed: 42
